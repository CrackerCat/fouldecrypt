# FoulDecrypt

FlexDecrypt's source code is pretty FAT, bundling the whole swift runtime to just achieve a simple mremap_encrypted.

And at the same time, foulplay independently found the same approach, and implemented it in a much more simple way.

I recompiled the foulplay for iOS, and a wrapper `flexdecrypt2` for flexdecrypt.
